      <description> Python and R are two different coding languages but they are still able to work together as seen below.

      <description>Introduction The first generation of Pokemon was first released in 1998, nearly 23 years ago, impacting millions of lives as a hit video game. As time has gone on, these 151 initial Pokemon have been remade since their first official release. The datasets chosen from Kaggle show the difference between these Pokemon in stats throughout the time. The datasets include the Pokemon, the identifying Pokedex number, each Pokemon’s attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed stats, their primary type, and identifies how far each Pokemon is in their evolution line.</description>

      <description>Introduction library(readxl) PokemonDataset &amp;lt;- read_excel(&amp;quot;PokemonDataset.xlsx&amp;quot;) For my project, I utilized data from Pokemon from Generation 1. There are 151 total observations for each variable in this dataset. The first variable studied is Evolution, which is the Pokemon’s relative position in the Evolution Line. Pokemon start off in the Base form, and then may evolve into Stage 1 and Stage 2 evolutions. The next 5 variables studied are attack, special attack, defense, special defense, and speed.</description>
